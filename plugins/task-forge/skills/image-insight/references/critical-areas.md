# Critical Analysis Areas

These areas require special attention for accurate style recreation.

## Hair Analysis (Critical)

### Hair Required Elements

- Exact length using body reference points (ears, shoulders, etc.)
- Specific cut style by name (bob, shag, fade, undercut, etc.)
- Texture pattern AND texture quality
- Natural imperfections: flyaways, frizz, uneven sections,
  growth patterns
- Part location with precision (e.g., "1 inch from center", "deep left")
- Styling state with product evidence
- Volume and movement quality
- All unique features (bangs, layers, fades, undercuts)

### Hair Anti-Patterns

- NEVER describe hair as "perfect" or overly uniform
- AVOID "AI smooth" descriptions - real hair has natural variation
- DON'T use vague terms like "nice hair" or "good condition"

## Hand and Gesture Analysis (Critical)

### Hand Required Elements

- Position of EACH hand separately (left and right)
- Visibility status (visible, in pockets, behind back, out of frame)
- Exact finger configurations and shapes
- For clasped hands: interlacing pattern (loose/tight), thumb positions,
  finger overlap
- Hand tension assessment (relaxed vs tense)
- What hands are interacting with
- Natural vs posed quality with evidence
- Contact points and pressure

### Hand Anti-Patterns

- DON'T skip hand position for portraits
- DON'T assume hand positions without evidence
- AVOID generic descriptions like "hands visible"

## Background Analysis (Critical)

### Wall Material Distinction

Distinguish between:

- Painted drywall (smooth, residential)
- Concrete (raw, textured, industrial)
- Brick (exposed, painted)
- Wood paneling
- Tile/Wallpaper/Plaster

### Background Required Elements

- Every visible object cataloged with quadrant position
- Plant species identification
  (monstera, pothos, bird of paradise, fern - NOT just "plant")
- Wall surface treatment (smooth paint vs textured vs raw vs polished)
- Wall finish (matte vs glossy vs satin)
- Wall condition (pristine vs weathered vs industrial)
- Surface features: water stains, streaks, cracks, patches
- Floor materials with exact colors
- Spatial depth layers for each element
- Object conditions and states
- Architectural features (windows, doors, molding, fixtures)

## Lighting Analysis (Critical)

### Directionality Assessment

- Highly directional: strong shadows, sculpted appearance
- Moderately directional: visible shadows with some fill
- Diffused: soft minimal shadows
- Omni-directional: flat, even illumination

### Shadow Characteristics

- Edge quality: harsh defined vs soft gradual vs minimal
- Density: deep black vs gray vs faint
- Placement: under subject, on wall, cast patterns
- Length: short, medium, long projection distance

### Lighting Required Elements

- Light source type and direction
- Contrast ratio (high/medium/low)
- Cast shadows from objects onto walls
- Presence or absence of ambient fill light
- Whether lighting sculpts the subject vs evenly illuminates
- Light temperature (warm golden, neutral, cool blue)

## Facial Expression Analysis (Critical)

### Facial Expression Required Elements

- Exact mouth position (closed smile, slight smile, neutral, serious)
- Smile intensity quantification (no smile, subtle, moderate, broad)
- Eye expression and gaze direction
- Eyebrow position (raised, neutral, furrowed)
- Overall emotional tone (warm approachable, serious neutral, etc.)
- Genuine vs posed quality assessment

### Assessment Criteria

- Authenticity: genuine, posed, candid, formal, natural
- Emotion: happy, content, serious, playful, confident, approachable,
  guarded, warm, cold
