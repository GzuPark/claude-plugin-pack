# Detailed Analysis Criteria

## Conflict Avoidance Patterns

### Hedging Language

- "maybe", "perhaps", "kind of", "sort of"
- "I think...", "I might be wrong, but..."
- "If you don't mind...", "If it's okay..."
- "just", "actually", "probably"

### Indirect Phrasing

- Using questions instead of direct requests
- Omitting subjects to avoid accountability
- Using "we" to dilute personal opinions
- Passive voice to avoid naming actors

### Topic-Shifting

- Abrupt topic changes when tension arises
- "Anyway...", "Moving on...", "Let's table that..."
- Circumventing core issues

### Non-Committal Agreement

- "Yeah, but...", "Sure, although..."
- Proceeding without clear stance
- Surface agreement without follow-through
- "That's interesting..." without engagement

## Speaking Metrics

### Speaking Ratio Calculation

```text
Speaking Ratio = (Individual Speaking Time / Total Meeting Time) x 100
```

Healthy ranges:

- 1:1 meetings: 40-60%
- Team meetings (5 people): 15-25%
- Large meetings (10+): 5-15%

### Interruption Types

- **Constructive**: Clarifying questions, urgent information
- **Non-constructive**: Blocking speech, derailing topics

### Question-to-Statement Ratio

- Leaders recommended: 1:2 to 1:3 (questions:statements)
- Coaching situations: 3:1 or higher (question-heavy)

## Filler Words

### Common Fillers

- "um", "uh", "er", "ah"
- "like", "you know", "I mean"
- "so", "basically", "literally"
- "right", "okay" (excessive use)

### Frequency Benchmarks

- Normal: 1-2 per minute
- Caution: 3-5 per minute
- Needs improvement: 5+ per minute

### Situational Patterns

Filler words typically increase when:

- Discussing uncertain topics
- Under pressure or stress
- Lacking preparation
- Explaining complex ideas

## Active Listening Indicators

### Referencing

- "As [Name] mentioned earlier..."
- "Building on what was just said..."
- "Going back to [specific point]..."

### Paraphrasing

- "So what you're saying is [interpretation]?"
- "Let me make sure I understand: [summary]"
- "If I'm hearing you correctly..."

### Clarifying Questions

- "Can you tell me more about [specific aspect]?"
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Could you give an example?"

### Expanding Questions

- "How do you see the next steps?"
- "What would that look like in practice?"
- "Have you considered [alternative]?"

## Leadership/Facilitation

### Decision-Making Styles

- **Directive**: States conclusion, then gathers input
- **Collaborative**: Gathers input, builds consensus
- **Delegative**: Transfers decision authority

### Inclusive Facilitation

- Inviting quieter participants to speak
- "I'd like to hear from those who haven't spoken yet"
- Actively soliciting diverse perspectives
- Acknowledging all contributions

### Meeting Control

- Time management and agenda adherence
- Redirecting when conversations derail
- Clear action items with owners and deadlines
- Summarizing decisions before moving on

## Output Example Template

### Conflict Avoidance Example

### Hedging on Critical Feedback

**Finding**: Excessive hedging language when delivering negative feedback

**Frequency**: 12 times across 7 meetings

**Examples**:
1. **1:1 with Sarah (2024-01-15)** - 14:32

   **What Happened**:
   > "So, I was thinking... maybe we could, like, potentially
   > consider looking at the timeline again? I mean, if you
   > think that makes sense. But whatever you think is best!"

   **Why This Matters**:
   The project was two weeks behind schedule, but the hedging
   language made it easy for Sarah to miss the urgency.

   **Better Approach**:
   "Sarah, the project is two weeks behind schedule. We need
   to discuss what's blocking progress and create a new
   timeline today."
```
